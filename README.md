### Purpose

This personal portfolio showcases academic and professional accomplishments. It exhibits various internships and projects completed as I pursued my software engineering degree.

### Design

A minimalist, full-page, responsive website using Bootstrap. The website was conceptualized and realized by myself. 

### Inspiration

Scouring the Internet in search of Bootstrap templates and personal portfolios by other software engineering students in order to generate design ideas for this website.

### Future Goals

Currently, the data specified in the website is hard-coded (such as project details). In order to achieve uniformity, increase maintainability, and reduce source code, fetching and populating data stored in a structured format (such as JSON) would be ideal.
